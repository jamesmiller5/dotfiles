--- Personal Notes on hardware customization ---
Prep
- Email myself personal package: pictures & configs
-- .dotfiles
+ .vimrc
+ .screenrc
missing: .${shell}rc

Mac Customs
+ homebrew
+ iTerm2, darkmode, background & hotkey fullscreen (usually same as flux)
   + iTerm2 -> Profiles -> Keys -> Presets: Natural Text Editing
   + Check dotfiles/macos/iterm2 for configs.
+ Dock, magnify & Hide
+ Desktops, multi w/ backgrounds
+ System -> Keyboard -> Enable Function keys, text replacements "omw" remove T_T.
+ System -> Control Center - {Wifi, Bluetooth, Sound - always show}

+ Finder 
- Add toolbars and stuff
- Add homedir to quick pane
- Default list view, remove grouping
- Sort date created, 
- Pictures (need gallery view)
- - sort by Name, make default

NOTABLE MISSING:
 Shell
	 Bash is my default
	 zsh for Mac
		# Turn on auto complete for zsh
		+ autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
	 (oil ?) - someday...
 Shell Config
	EDITOR=$(which vim)
	- Without this git breaks on MacOS
	.zshrc
		- see to-send-zshrc
		- TODO clean up that file

	TODO clean up to-send-snippets
		- .bash_profile
		- .bashrc
		- .zshrc
		- .profile
		- .zprofile
		Really this should all be bramble + some basic config thing. 
			-Maybe <sh+deps> -> enable stow -> enables bigger/better things.
 Editor
	Neovim (nvim) or Vim w/ term
 Git Config (global)
	Ignore vim swp files
		~/.config/git/ignore - default if I don't setup a .gitconfig w/ an alt file
		~/.config/git/hooks 
		- TODO make .config/git a stow'able.
		<<CONTENTS
		# Get it, ignore "swa-p"!
		.*.sw[a-p]
		CONTENTS
	TODO: Add this to my personal .tar
 Editor Config
	 ? - idea: Swap files diff location - https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Remove_swap_and_backup_files_from_your_working_directory
	- My rc files
 TermMuxer
	screen
		- my config
		- mouse support missing, breaks vim if used in screen
		- TODO macos/tweaks/brew install screen
	tmux - config
		- mouse support missing, see https://superuser.com/questions/989505/pass-mouse-events-through-tmux
 Config
	- No Bramble
	- Used a tarball to unpack my config, was kinda clunky
	- Could be used for all-the-above
 Software
	(?) - Maybe gento/emerge thing, would be nice to get basics
		- See TODO's above. 
	Likely will be nix stuff (someday)
        iterm2 - ~/export-dump.itermcolors
	Shell Bookmarks - import & export a nice list, porbably need a perosnal section and shared.
		Bookmarks - https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Examples#bookmarks
	Browser Bookmarks
		need basic import/export
		Orgmode for Jay, Job & overlap
 Other
	- ~/Pictures/personalization
		- has my avatars, backgrounds and such, could be rolled into bramble for personalization and all the above
			- see nix?
		- also keep a list of Slack emoji's
	- ~/src/shell-stuff/tomorrow-theme
	- ~/src/shell-stuff/color tests and stuff

TODO: could dump brew if its worth looking at my assumed software but nicer to transfer to nix for next project anyway.
- brew bundle dump -> Brewfile
- brew bundle install [./Brewfile] is amazing
TODO: Add above to my personal .tar and see if we can use Bramble or another tool to distribute + update

+ Week 1
  + jq, tree, csview

+ Week N
  + LICEcap
