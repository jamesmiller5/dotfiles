TODO need to organize these into a single stow command, or at least by repo.
	Stow considers top level as a "package", perhaps . will work?

	--dotfiles looks nice but is fluffy
	Understanding stow is better
	Symlinks are really nice, perl setup is also nice to test pre-packaged deps.
	- manual fallback is not so nice, but kinda cool for "seed" ideas. Bootstrapping.

	stow -vvv --dotfiles config
	stow -vvv --delete <package>
